# Solution Documentation Systems

A lightweight, easily maintained and updated, documentation framework for software components, systems, and solutions. 

The framework provides a directory structure and templates that can be used to produce software documentation that is logically structured, follows industry best practices and is easily maintained and extended by developers. You may pick and choose which sections you wish to complete and may add more sections if required. 

The content is formatted with markdown and stored in a github repository. The use of github and markdown provides simple markup language and a comprehensive version control system, that is already familiar to  most developers.
