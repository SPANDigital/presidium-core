# PlayerPro Job Service

## Testing

### Run Unit Tests

```sh
$ python -m unittest discover tests
```

### Run Integration Tests

Currently integration tests rely on zookeeper, kafka, job_service and overlord all running. 
Furthermore integration tests rely on ```feed_manager.worker_url``` being set to: 
http://localhost:8000?type={type}&id={id}

```sh
$ python -m unittest discover integration_tests
```

### Run All Tests

```sh
$ python -m unittest discover
```

**Remember to specify tests, specifically with python3.5 the imports
will work, but your mocks will fail.**

### Deployment Considerations

#### Ansible >= 2.1.1.0
Ensure your ansible is up to date, check version:

```sh
$ ansible-playbook --version
```

http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html

```sh
$ sudo pip install ansible
```

#### Prepare servers
Configure network and provision servers in EC2, with basic configuration in place.

```sh
$ ansible-playbook -i aws_host/ec2.py prepare_servers.yml -e "@vars/span.yml" --private-key=aws-load_testing-private.pem
```

#### Install Kafka
Install Kafka on servers

```sh
$ ansible-playbook -i kafka-testing-inventory install_kafka.yml -e "@vars/span.yml" --private-key=aws-load_testing-private.pem --user=ubuntu
```

#### Deploy Job Service
Install Job Service on servers

### Kafka Developer Notes ###

#### Using Kafka On Mac ####

If you've used Brew to install kafka, you can easily start/stop kafka:

```sh
$ brew services restart kafka
```

You can edit kafka config here:

```sh
$ vi /usr/local/etc/kafka/server.properties
```

**Disclaimer:** brew doesn't always have the latest version of Kafka,
rather download the latest version and run as per:
http://kafka.apache.org/quickstart

#### Publish Dummy Events ####

```sh
$ ./produce_event.py --json sample/mock_event.json --loops 100
```

#### Kafka Tools ####
List consumer groups

```sh
$ bin/kafka-run-class.sh kafka.admin.ConsumerGroupCommand --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list
```

Get some basic info about a particular group:

```sh
$ bin/kafka-run-class.sh kafka.admin.ConsumerGroupCommand --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --group playerpro-event-consumer-group
```

and

```sh
$ bin/kafka-run-class.sh kafka.admin.ConsumerGroupCommand --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --group playerpro-job-consumer-group
```

### Sanity Checks ###

#### Check that events are being received and processed
If correctly configured, all transactions with the PlayerPro API will result in events being published
to the incoming events topic that the job service is listening to. Using the [Kafka Tools](#kafka-tools)
one can confirm that events are being received and processed, and that jobs are being recieved and 
processed.

## Debugging
The Job Service can be run using pdb (or using an IDE) on a development machine, with events injected
using produce_event.py to assist in running through various scenarios.

In all other environments, the log files generated by the application can be utilised to debug this system.

# PlayerPro API

## Running Tests

```sh
$ python tests/run_tests.py
```

OR

```sh
$ python -m unittest discover
```

## Debugging
The python api can be run using pdb (or using and IDE) on a development machine, with transaction created
using an application such as curl (on *nix environments), [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or 
[Paw](https://paw.cloud/).
